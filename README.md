# LineFollowerBot
This project is for a line follower bot that uses a PID controller and can make 90-degree turns. The bot uses an IR Sensor Array Module anlso known as QTR Sensors to follow a black line on a white surface or could be reversed. The PID controller is used to maintain the position of the bot on the line. When the bot encounters an intersection, it uses a combination of the IR sensors and the L298N motor driver to make a 90-degree turn. The bot is powered by a 11.1V LIpo battery and controlled using an Arduino UNO board. The code is written in the Arduino IDE and uses the Wire.h and QTRsensor.h libraries. This project has manged to win First rank in Annual techfest at IIT Mandi.
